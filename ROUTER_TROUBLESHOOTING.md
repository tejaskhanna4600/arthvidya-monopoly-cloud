#### **Solutions:**
1. **Check Port Forwarding Configuration:**
   - **Service Name**: `Monopoly Game`
   - **Protocol**: `TCP` (or `Both`)
   - **External Port**: `8501`
   - **Internal Port**: `8501`
   - **Internal IP**: Your laptop's IP address
   - **Enabled**: `Yes` or `On`

2. **Verify Laptop IP:**
   ```bash
   # Run this to get your laptop's IP
   python network_info.py
   ```

3. **Check Port Number:**
   - Make sure you're using the correct port (usually 8501)
   - Check what port your Streamlit app is using

4. **Restart Router:**
   - Save port forwarding configuration
   - Restart router

1. **Check Public IP:**
   ```bash
   # Get your public IP
   python network_info.py
   ```

2. **Test from Different Network:**
   - Use mobile data (not WiFi)
   - Try from a different WiFi network
   - Ask someone else to test the URL

3. **Check Port Forwarding:**
   - Verify port forwarding is configured correctly
   - Make sure the rule is enabled
   - Check that internal IP is correct

4. **Check Firewall:**
   - Windows: Allow Python/Streamlit through firewall
   - Mac: Allow Python in Security & Privacy
   - Linux: `sudo ufw allow 8501`

### **Issue 4: Connection Refused**

   - Restart Streamlit if needed

2. **Check Port Number:**
   - Verify you're using the correct port
   - Check if port is already in use
   - Try a different port if needed

3. **Check IP Address:**
   - Make sure IP address is correct
   - Check if laptop IP has changed
   - Update port forwarding if needed

4. **Check Firewall:**
   - Allow Python/Streamlit through firewall
   - Check both Windows and router firewall
   - Temporarily disable firewall to test

### **Issue 5: Slow Performance**
